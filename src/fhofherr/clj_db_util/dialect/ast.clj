  led to the AST.

  A location within the AST is considered a rule if it is a branch node of the
  AST and if its first child is a keyword.

  current location.

  The location given to `get-rule` has to be a rule as defined by [[rule?]].
  The keyword which is the first child of a rule location is interpreted as the
  rules name and returned. If the given location does not represent a rule `nil`
